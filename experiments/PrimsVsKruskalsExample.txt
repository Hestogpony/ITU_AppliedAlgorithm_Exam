Experiments description:

	Hypothesis:
		
		For a Graphs (Grid graph) on n = 25.000 Vertices and for #edges, m < (1/50 * 4), 
		Prim's is faster than Kruskal's. 

	Factors:

		Algorithm(s): Prim's vs Kruskal's

		Instance: disconnected Graphs

		Environment: Own computer (check specs)

		Fixed parameters: #nodes, #edges, weights, #connected components
						  fixed   vary    fixed    vary    
						
		Noise parameters: 		
		
	Conclusion:
	
		Kruskal's is initlially worse than Prim's. But as the number of edges and 
		number of connected components increase Kruskal's becomes better and better 
		compared to Prim's, and at some point overtake Prim's.
