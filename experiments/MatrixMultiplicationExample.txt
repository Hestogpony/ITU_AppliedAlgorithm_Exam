Experiments description:

	Hypothesis:
		
		Implementation X has running time c * n^3 for dimension of square
		matrices n > 1000. 

	Factors:

		Algorithm(s): Matrix Multiplication

		Instance: 
			- Tiling
			- Non-tiling
			- Binary matrix
		
		Environment: 
			- Available memory
			- Type of CPU
			- Compiler brand
		
		Fixed parameters: 
			- Bit-size of the floats
			- Dimension n of Matrix
			- #Threads (if it is a tiling matrix instance)
			- numbers: 0s, denormalized 
						
		Noise parameters: 		
			- Additional CPU load
